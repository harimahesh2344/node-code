The assignment has two files- 
1.  main.js  -  Simple  Node/Express  REST  API  that  returns  a 
“Hello, World!” response on port  3000 
2.  package.json  - Dependency management file 
Step  2:  Check  if  Node.js  is  installed  on  your  computer,  if  not  then 
install it. 
Step  3:  Run  npm  install  ,  it  will  generate  node_modules  and 
package-lock.json 
Step  4:  Run  node  main.js  ,  the  API  can  now  be  accessed  on 
http://localhost:3000  and you’ll see the response “Hello, World!”. 
Step 5:  Create a  Dockerfile  to build an image of the above code. 
Step  6:  Run  a  container  using  the  created  image.  (Don’t  forget  to 
expose the required port/(s)). 
Step 7:  Access the API and you must see the response “Hello World!”. 
BONUS:  Write  a  docker-compose.yml  file  and  use  docker-compose  to 
complete the assignment. 
Once  the  assignment  has  been  completed,  push  it  on  GitHub  and  share 
the repo link with us.
